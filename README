============================

This module is an interface to Win32 CryptProtectData and CryptUnprotectData
functions and data structures, needed to crypt and decrypt data on the local
computer without requiring passwords.
The encrypted data can be successfully decrypted only by the same logged user

provided by the Win32 Crypto API.
